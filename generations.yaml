    description: "The Citroën Basalt is a compact fastback sedan developed primarily for emerging markets, particularly South America. Based on the Citroën C3 platform (itself built on Stellantis' CMP architecture), it features a distinctive coupe-like silhouette with a sloping roofline that creates a dynamic profile between a traditional sedan and an SUV. The exterior design incorporates Citroën's current styling language with the brand's signature two-tier lighting arrangement, a prominent double-chevron logo integrated into the grille, and distinctive 'Airbump' protective panels on the lower doors. The interior offers a modern, simplified design with a floating touchscreen infotainment system, digital instrument options, and practical storage solutions. Powertrain options typically include a 1.0L naturally aspirated or 1.0L turbocharged three-cylinder engine, depending on the market, paired with manual or automatic transmissions. The Basalt represents Citroën's strategy to expand its presence in emerging markets with vehicles specifically designed for regional preferences, in this case addressing the popularity of sedan-type vehicles in South America while incorporating contemporary crossover styling elements. With its elevated ride height (around 180mm ground clearance) and protective body cladding, it's positioned as an urban vehicle that can handle rougher road conditions common in its target markets."
